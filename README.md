# Multipage Form submission UI/UX (ReactJS)
Form Submission with ReactJs using useContext and Provider


1. Install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/):

   ```bash
    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x -o /tmp/nodesource_setup.sh
    sudo bash /tmp/nodesource_setup.sh
    sudo apt install nodejs
   ```

2. Check out `react-form-submission`, and install required npm packages:

   Run the below command inside the project directory \
   npm < 7
   ```bash
    npm install
   ```

   npm >= 7
   ```bash
    npm install --force
   ```
   
## Run the app in the development mode.
   ```bash
    npm start
   ```
After successful build, it invokes the browser and opens the app here [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

The page will reload when any change is made.


## Build the app for production to the `build` folder.
   ```bash
    npm run build
   ```

Above command bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
